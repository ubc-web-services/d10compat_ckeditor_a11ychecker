CKEditor Accessibility Checker
==============================

Description
===========
Accessibility Checker is an innovative solution that lets you inspect the
accessibility level of content created in CKEditor and immediately solve any
accessibility issues that are found.

It is built upon three key elements:

* User Interface optimized for quick problem solving.
* Flexibility allowing you to use the accessibility checking engine of your
  choice.
* Quick Fix feature letting you fix common problems fully automatically!

The default implementation uses Quail as its accessibility tests library, but
you can integrate any other similar library to achieve comparable results.

Usage

add the YouTube Button to any CKEditor-enabled text format you want.
